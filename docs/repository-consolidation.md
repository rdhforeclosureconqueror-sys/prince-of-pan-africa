# Repository Consolidation Notes

This repository contains both:
- Prince of Pan-Africa frontend (root app structure)
- Prince of Pan-Africa backend (`backend/` FastAPI)

## Logical structure
- `backend/` → FastAPI backend service
- `frontend/` → frontend transition docs
- `config/` → deployment and environment templates
- `docs/` → operational documentation

## Stability note
Frontend source remains in its current root layout to avoid breaking existing build/deploy behavior.
