  hook:
    "Decolonization is not anger, nostalgia, or rejection of learning. It is the reordering of perception so you can see clearly before choosing what to keep, what to discard, and what to rebuild.",
  core: {
    L1:
      "In mainstream academic and political usage, decolonization originally referred to the formal process by which colonized territories gained independence from imperial powers. This definition focused on governance, borders, and sovereignty. Over time, scholars recognized that political independence alone did not undo colonial control. This led to the concept of epistemic decolonization: the examination of who defines knowledge, whose histories are taught, whose values are treated as universal, and which ways of knowing are marginalized or excluded. Under this lens, colonial power persists through education systems, media narratives, legal norms, and institutional standards that continue to privilege the worldview of the colonizer even after formal empire ends. Decolonization at this level involves questioning curricula, research frameworks, cultural assumptions, and the authority structures that decide what counts as legitimate knowledge.",
    L2:
      "From Afro-Indigenous perspectives, decolonization is not primarily an academic critique; it is an act of remembrance and re-centering. It begins with the understanding that identity is not abstract but rooted in land, lineage, rhythm, responsibility, and lived relationship. To decolonize is to remember before replacing — to recover self-definition that existed prior to imposed categories, names, and hierarchies. This lens does not reject external knowledge or modern tools outright. Instead, it re-anchors them within ancestral memory, communal ethics, and embodied experience. Knowledge is evaluated not only by accuracy, but by whether it sustains life, balance, and continuity. In this view, decolonization is inseparable from daily practice: how one understands self, community, time, and purpose.",
    L3:
      "Colonial systems rarely announce themselves as domination. Instead, they operate through recurring power-patterns that shape perception quietly and consistently. One core pattern is RENAME: changing names of people, lands, and practices to sever memory and disconnect identity from origin. Another is MORALIZE: framing conquest, extraction, or control as a civilizing mission, progress, or necessity. PROPERTY is a key mechanism, transforming land, bodies, labor, and even ideas into assets that can be owned, traded, or exploited. SANITIZE removes visible violence from official narratives, making domination appear orderly or inevitable. ERASE completes the cycle by omitting stories of resistance, thriving alternatives, and successful self-governance.\n\nAt the mental level, decolonization means learning to detect these patterns automatically, before they shape belief. It also requires a disciplined relationship to truth. Decolonization does not mean replacing one rigid certainty with another. It means learning to live with tiered truth: Attested (supported by strong, verifiable evidence), Plausible (reasonable but incomplete or contested), and Speculative (meaningful, intuitive, or experiential, but not yet proven). This approach resists both blind skepticism and blind belief. Humility here is not weakness; it is epistemic strength. It allows learning without submission and critique without cynicism."

  practice:
    "Action (10–15 minutes): Write two definitions of the word “decolonization.” First, write the definition you have heard most often from schools, media, or social discourse. Second, write the definition that feels most accurate to your lived experience and inner sense of truth. Do not edit for correctness — write for clarity.",
